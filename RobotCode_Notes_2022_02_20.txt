2/20/2022   JAS  Robot Code Notes.

General
	-- implement a trajectory following VI similar to DriveForwardDistance.

Team Code
	Teleop
	-- DONT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES in this VI.  Call your "setter" VIs !!!!


DriveSystem
	DriveForwardDistance
	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 7.0) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...
	

	ExecuteSpeed
	-- If there is time, the PID could be tuned a little.
		Ki can probably be larger..  (maybe between 1 and 2)
	-- Add a global variable to indicate Auto(closed loop)/Manual(open loop).  
		Use this to switch.  Initialize to auto.  Write state to network 
		tables.

	GetDrive
	-- Calibrate Lidar

	SetDistanceFromWall

	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...

	TurnDistance.

	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 45) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...  (It doesn't matter that
		the error is degrees and speed is ft/sec...slope is still slope.)

Autonomous
	
	DropIntake
	-- use setter VI not global variable.

Auxiliary

	GetAux
	-- add filtering after shooter speed calculation
